## 📘 About This Repository  
This repository documents my **daily progress** as I solve Data Structures & Algorithms problems from the famous **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**.

I created this repo to:

- Build a **strong foundation** in DSA  
- Stay **consistent** every day  
- Improve my **logic, patterns, and intuition**  
- Prepare for **coding interviews & placement rounds**  
- Maintain a **beautiful GitHub activity graph**  
- Track my entire **learning journey** in one place
